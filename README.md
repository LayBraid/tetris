# tetris

The goal of this project is to create our own *TETRIS* in **C**, using the **ncurses** library.

## Usage

*To compile the game, you'll need the ncurses library installed on your PC and the C binding of it (ncurses).*<br>
Get in the directory and use the `make` command in your terminal.<br>
Then just type `./tetris` and you're good to go !<br>
